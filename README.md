# DCS Server Scripts

WIP

PowerShell scripts I use for my DCS World server.

## How to use

### DCS install script

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following:

`iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CourtesyFlushGH/dcs-server-scripts/main/install-dcs.ps1 | iex`

Go through the install GUIs.

In WinUtil the proper packages should be selected, press `Install/Upgrade Applications`.
